# geomjax
 Jax implementation of Riemannian Monte Carlo methods based on [blackjax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax) library.
 
 * Riemann Manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Girolami et al. 2011).
 * Lagrangian Dynamical Monte Carlo (Lan et al. 2015).
 * Lagrangian Manifold Monte Carlo on Monge patches (Hartmann et al. 2022).

Install requirements by running in terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
The installation can be done with the terminal command  `pip install -e .` from the directory containing this README.

For an example of usage refer to **examples/funnel**.
