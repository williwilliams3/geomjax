    """Build an iterative NUTS kernel.

    This algorithm is an iteration on the original NUTS algorithm :cite:p:`hoffman2014no`
    with two major differences:

    - We do not use slice samplig but multinomial sampling for the proposal
      :cite:p:`betancourt2017conceptual`;
    - The trajectory expansion is not recursive but iterative :cite:p:`phan2019composable`,
      :cite:p:`lao2020tfp`.

    The implementation can seem unusual for those familiar with similar
    algorithms. Indeed, we do not conceptualize the trajectory construction as
    building a tree. We feel that the tree lingo, inherited from the recursive
    version, is unnecessarily complicated and hides the more general concepts
    upon which the NUTS algorithm is built.

    NUTS, in essence, consists in sampling a trajectory by iteratively choosing
    a direction at random and integrating in this direction a number of times
    that doubles at every step. From this trajectory we continuously sample a
    proposal. When the trajectory turns on itself or when we have reached the
    maximum trajectory length we return the current proposal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    integrator
        The simplectic integrator used to build trajectories.
    divergence_threshold
        The absolute difference in energy above which we consider
        a transition "divergent".
    max_num_doublings
        The maximum number of times we expand the trajectory by
        doubling the number of steps if the trajectory does not
        turn onto itself.

class nutslmc:
    """Implements the (basic) user interface for the nuts kernel.

    Examples
    --------

    A new NUTS kernel can be initialized and used with the following code:

    .. code::

        nuts = blackjax.nuts(logdensity_fn, step_size, inverse_mass_matrix)
        state = nuts.init(position)
        new_state, info = nuts.step(rng_key, state)

    We can JIT-compile the step function for more speed:

    .. code::

        step = jax.jit(nuts.step)
        new_state, info = step(rng_key, state)

    You can always use the base kernel should you need to:

    .. code::

       import blackjax.mcmc.integrators as integrators

       kernel = blackjax.nuts.build_kernel(integrators.yoshida)
       state = blackjax.nuts.init(position, logdensity_fn)
       state, info = kernel(rng_key, state, logdensity_fn, step_size, inverse_mass_matrix)

    Parameters
    ----------
    logdensity_fn
        The log-density function we wish to draw samples from.
    step_size
        The value to use for the step size in the symplectic integrator.
    inverse_mass_matrix
        The value to use for the inverse mass matrix when drawing a value for
        the velocity and computing the kinetic energy.
    max_num_doublings
        The maximum number of times we double the length of the trajectory before
        returning if no U-turn has been obserbed or no divergence has occured.
    divergence_threshold
        The absolute value of the difference in energy between two states above
        which we say that the transition is divergent. The default value is
        commonly found in other libraries, and yet is arbitrary.
    integrator
        (algorithm parameter) The symplectic integrator to use to integrate the trajectory.
